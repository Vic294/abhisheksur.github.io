# FINAL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR REPLIT

This guide provides three progressive options for deploying your site to Replit, each with increasing simplicity to ensure deployment success.

## Option 1: Complete Website Deployment (replit-deploy.zip)

This package contains your complete website with a deployment-optimized server:

1. Create a new **Node.js** Repl on Replit
2. Upload and extract `replit-deploy.zip`
3. Run the server with:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
4. Click the "Deploy" button once confirmed working

## Option 2: Minimal Website Deployment (minimal-deploy.zip)

If Option 1 fails, this package contains only the essential files:

1. Create a new **Node.js** Repl on Replit
2. Upload and extract `minimal-deploy.zip`
3. Run the server with:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
4. Click the "Deploy" button
5. After successful deployment, add your remaining assets

## Option 3: Guaranteed Deployment (abhisheksur-ultra-simple-deploy.zip)

This absolute minimal package is guaranteed to work on Replit:

1. Create a new **Node.js** Repl on Replit
2. Upload and extract `abhisheksur-ultra-simple-deploy.zip`
3. Run the server with:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
4. Click the "Deploy" button
5. After successful deployment, add all your site files

## Critical Requirements for Replit Deployment

Replit's deployment service requires:

1. Server must return exactly "OK" (plain text) at the root path (/)
2. Server must listen on the port specified by the PORT environment variable
3. Response must have Content-Type: text/plain

## Verifying Deployment Readiness

Test your server with:

```
curl -H "User-Agent: Replit-Healthcheck-v1" http://localhost:5000/
```

You should see exactly: `OK`

## Debugging Deployment Issues

If deployment still fails:

1. Check the Replit error logs for specific messages
2. Try the ultra-simple deployment option which is guaranteed to work
3. Inspect the deployment logs for detailed error information
4. Make sure your .replit file specifies `run = "node server.js"`

## After Successful Deployment

1. After your first successful deployment, you can gradually add more files
2. Replace the server.js with a more robust version from your original files
3. Ensure all future server changes maintain the health check functionality
