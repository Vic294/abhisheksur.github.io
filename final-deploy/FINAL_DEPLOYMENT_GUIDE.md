# FINAL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE FOR ABHISHEK SUR'S PORTFOLIO

## THREE OPTIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT

I've created three different server implementations to ensure your website deploys successfully on Replit:

1. **portfolio-server.js** (Recommended)
   - Comprehensive server with proper health checks
   - Detailed logging and error handling
   - Flexible port configuration (3000 for preview, 5000 for deployment)

2. **server.js**
   - Simplified version of the portfolio server
   - Handles health checks and static file serving
   - Compatible with Replit deployment requirements

3. **index.js**
   - Identical to server.js for maximum compatibility
   - Useful if Replit expects an index.js file

## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Option 1: Use the Deployment Package (Recommended)

1. Download the **final-abhisheksur-deploy.zip** file
2. Create a new Node.js Repl on Replit
3. Upload the zip file and extract it
4. In Replit, set the run command to:
   ```
   node portfolio-server.js
   ```
5. Click Run

### Option 2: Manual File Upload

If you need to upload files individually:

1. Create a new Node.js Repl on Replit
2. Upload these files to the root directory:
   - portfolio-server.js (or server.js)
   - package.json
   - All HTML files
   - All asset files and folders
3. Set the run command to:
   ```
   node portfolio-server.js
   ```

## REPLIT DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

Your server must:
1. Listen on port 5000 in production (automatically handled by the PORT environment variable)
2. Respond to the root path (/) with "OK" in plain text
3. Have a server.js file at the root level

All of these requirements are met by the provided server implementations.

## ACCESSING YOUR WEBSITE

After deployment:
- The root URL will return "OK" for health checks
- Your website will be accessible at:
  - https://your-repl-name.your-username.repl.co/index.html

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If deployment fails:
1. Check the Replit logs for specific errors
2. Try using server.js instead of portfolio-server.js
3. Ensure all files are at the root level
4. Verify that the server is running on port 5000 or using process.env.PORT
