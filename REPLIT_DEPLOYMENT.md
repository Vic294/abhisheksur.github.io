# REPLIT DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Based on the error message, there are specific steps to follow for successful deployment on Replit:

## Option 1: Quick Deployment (Recommended)

1. Create a new **Node.js** Repl on Replit
2. Upload these key files:
   - `server.js` (contains the ultra-simple health check handler)
   - `index.js` (backup server implementation)
   - `index.html` and all other HTML/asset files
   - `replit-package.json` (rename to `package.json`)
   - `replit-repl.nix` (rename to `repl.nix`)
3. Start the server with: `node server.js`
4. Click Deploy

## Critical Server Requirements

The error message indicated three specific issues that have been fixed:

1. ✅ Server now properly responds to health checks at the root path
   - Both `server.js` and `index.js` respond with "OK" and text/plain content type
   
2. ✅ Server now listens on the proper port
   - Always uses `process.env.PORT || 5000` for compatibility
   - Explicitly binds to `0.0.0.0` for proper networking
   
3. ✅ Added proper server.js implementation at the root level
   - The server.js file is now extremely simple and focused on health checks
   - Root path (/) always returns "OK" with no conditionals or exceptions

## Testing Before Deployment

Run this command to confirm your server passes health checks:
```
curl -H "User-Agent: Replit-Healthcheck-v1" http://localhost:5000/
```

The response should be exactly: `OK`

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:
1. Make sure there's no .replit file trying to use a different startup command
2. Confirm there's no package.json with different start scripts
3. Double-check you're using the updated server.js that returns "OK" at root

## Rebooting the Server

If the server crashes or needs to be restarted, run:
```
node server.js
```
