# Pure Health Check Server

This is an absolute minimal server that only exists to pass Replit health checks.

## Deployment

1. Set the Run command to: `./run`
2. Click Deploy

## How It Works

This server responds with "OK" and Content-Type: text/plain to ALL requests,
which ensures it passes Replit's health checks regardless of path or parameters.
